Laravel makes it easy to protect your application from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. 

- Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session managed by the application.
  This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the one actually making the requests to the application.
  
- The VerifyCsrfToken middleware, which is included in the web middleware group, will automatically verify that the token 
  in the request input matches the token stored in the session.
