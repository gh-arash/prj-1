1- Server requirements: PHP, a local server software. 

   - Install XAMPP (to create a local server and local IP) and Download PHP.
   
2- Install Composer (a dependency manager to install different packages such as laravel)
   * we can download different packages from packagist.org

3- run this command on terminal to create a new laravel project:
   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project_name

4- Local Development Server: we can use command : php artisan serve to create a local server 
   another way is start apache and mysql in XAMMP.
